# Astrology Project
An astrology project based upon sweph.

This astrology software displays planetary bodies on a horizontal graph. It is possible to choose a planetary body, and display it on a certain selected timeline.

# Databases
There are 3 zip files containing the databases with the calculated planetary bodies. These need to be extracted, and added into a database in order to query them through the PHP files.
