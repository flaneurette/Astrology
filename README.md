# Astrology Project
An astrology project based upon sweph.

This astrology software displays planetary bodies on a horizontal graph. It is possible to choose a planetary body, and display it on a certain selected timeline, ranging from 2000 BC to 2100 AD. This gives a clear calculation to see when a planet was in a certain sign.

# Databases
There are 3 zip files containing the databases with the calculated planetary bodies. These need to be extracted, and added into a database in order to query them through the PHP files.

# Planetary objects

	- Sun
